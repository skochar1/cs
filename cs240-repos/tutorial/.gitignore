# This file tells Git to ignore certain files (i.e., never add/commit
# them to the repository).

# In general, it is good version-control style to avoid committing
# files that are automatically generated from source code files in the
# repository.

# Emacs temporary auto-backup files.

# The compiled executable can always be regenerated from the source
